The lab was proposed by Lydia Rodarte-Quayle and financed by Gustavo Fring and Peter Schuler, with the project costing over $8 million.\n\nConstruction was organized and supervised by Mike Ehrmantraut. A first construction team, headed by Werner Ziegler, worked from April 2003 to March 2004 on the project, clearing out the space, and beginning preliminary foundational work. An unknown second team was hired sometime after June 2004, finishing the project sometime prior to March 2009. It was constructed for the purpose of manufacturing industrial amounts of illicit methamphetamine and thus played a vital role in the expansion of Gus\u0027 drug empire.\n\nThe Superlab was capable of cooking between 100 and 300 pounds of meth per week. Its layout was designed by chemist Gale Boetticher, who specified its every detail, including the apparatus required.",
